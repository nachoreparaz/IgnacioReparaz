# Proyectos
<h3>Menu App</h3>
<p> 
I develop a menu in ReactJS for a restaurant. This application utilizes Firestore as its database,  connected to the 
restaurant's Google Sheets. This integration allows for easy and real-time price updates, offering  a dynamic and 
efficient experience for both users and the restaurant team
</p>


<h3>E-commics</h3>
<p>Development of a group app for buying or selling products related to pop culture. To perform actions such as buying, selling, adding to cart, or adding to favorites, users need to register and log into the app. Upon purchasing a product, they will receive a confirmation email. Additionally, the app includes a Newsletter section where consumers can stay updated with the latest news.
